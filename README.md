Package manager for git repositories.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/270298.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/270298)

## Installation

To install from pypi run:


```sh
pip3 install gitget
```

## Usage

Gitget allows you to manage repositories download from git hosts like github or
gitlab. The repositories are treated like software 'packages', and basic tasks
such as downloading and saving information about repositories, updating
repository, and removing them once they aren't needed anymore. The contents of
the git repositories is not changed; installation scripts are not run and
dependencies are not installed (yet).

### Help

    gitget -h
    gitget --help
    gitget help <command>

Displays a help menu. If the `help` command is used, a help menu for a specific
command is displayed.

### Install

    gitget install <package>
    gitget install <package> <package_name>

Downloads a repository from github and saves information about it.
Optionally, a name for the package can be specified. This name will also
be used as the directory name. Otherwise, the package name is set to
`username/repository`.

### Remove

    gitget remove <repository_name>
    gitget remove <repository_name> --soft

Removes a repository from the package list and also deletes the files locally.
If the `--soft` flag is passed, the local files will not be deleted.

### Update

    gitget update

Runs `git-pull` on all packages in the package list to update them.

### Move

    gitget move <package_name> <location>

Moves a package from location to another and updates the information about it.

### Doctor

    gitget doctor

Verifies integrity of files and packages. Any errors are then reported
and need to be fixed.

### List

    gitget list

Lists all packages and install locations.

### Edit

    gitget edit

Opens the default editor (run `echo $EDITOR`) to edit the package file.

### Setup

    gitget setup

Creates the `.gitget.yaml` package file, where all the package information is
saved.

## Development

```shell
conda activate py3.10

pip uninstall gitget

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

gitget --version
```
